Try to explain different concepts from GPU programming in CPU 
terms, by using one overarching abstraction of thread context. 


For example you could simulate the processing of multiple threads 
running at the same time on one cpu core by reducing the context 
of each thread down to a minimum of registers. Broadcasting loads 
are modelled as a load to one register. Coalescing loads 
are modelled through simd loads. The threads in this context 
become very virtual, but by trying to manage all this on one 
cpu core we can perhaps model why Coalescing is so important 
on the GPU considering the number of load instructions we'd have to 
issue otherwise.
